Tasks
0. Square Matrix Simple
This script defines a function square_matrix_simple(matrix) that takes a 2-dimensional array (matrix) as input and returns a new matrix with each element being the square of the corresponding element in the input matrix. The initial matrix is not modified.

1. Search and Replace
The script contains a function search_replace(my_list, search, replace) that replaces all occurrences of a specified element (search) with another element (replace) in a new list.

2. Unique Addition
This script defines a function uniq_add(my_list) that adds all unique integers in a list, considering each integer only once.

3. Present in Both
The script contains a function common_elements(set_1, set_2) that returns a set of common elements between two sets.

4. Only Differents
This script defines a function only_diff_elements(set_1, set_2) that returns a set of all elements present in only one of the two sets.

5. Number of Keys
The script contains a function number_keys(a_dictionary) that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.

6. Print Sorted Dictionary
This script defines a function print_sorted_dictionary(a_dictionary) that prints the keys of a dictionary in alphabetic order.

7. Update Dictionary
The script contains a function update_dictionary(a_dictionary, key, value) that replaces or adds a key-value pair in a dictionary.

8. Simple Delete by Key
This script defines a function simple_delete(a_dictionary, key="") that deletes a key in a dictionary if it exists.

9. Multiply by 2
The script contains a function multiply_by_2(a_dictionary) that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.

10. Best Score
This script defines a function best_score(a_dictionary) that returns the key with the highest integer value in a dictionary.

11. Multiply by Using Map
The script contains a function multiply_list_map(my_list=[], number=0) that returns a new list with all values multiplied by a specified number, using the map function.

12. Roman to Integer
This script defines a function roman_to_int(roman_string) that converts a Roman numeral to an integer. The function can handle Roman numerals within the range of 1 to 3999.
